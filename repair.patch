This includes support for ESM in Electron proper, as well as areas such as the `UtilityProcess` API entrypoints. [See our ESM documentation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/esm) for more details.
 - In addition to enabling ESM support in Electron itself, Electron Forge also supports using ESM to package, build and develop Electron applications. You can find this support in [Forge v7.0.0](https://github.com/electron/forge/releases/tag/v7.0.0) or higher.

 - Added a new top-level `webUtils` module, a renderer process module that provides a utility layer to interact with Web API objects. The first available API in the module is `webUtils.getPathForFile`.

 Since the beginning of Electron, starting way back when it used to be called Atom-Shell, we have been experimenting with providing a nice cross-platform JavaScript API for Chromium's content module and native GUI components.

 Now with Electron gearing up for a 1.0 release, we'd like to take the opportunity for change by addressing the last niggling API details. The changes described below are included in **0.35.x**, with the old APIs reporting deprecation warnings so you can get up to date for the future 1.0 release. An Electron 1.0 won't be out for a few months so you have some time before these changes become breaking.
